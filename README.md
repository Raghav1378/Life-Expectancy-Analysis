# Life-Expectancy-Analysis
This project explores the "Life Expectancy (WHO)" dataset and uses machine learning techniques to predict life expectancy based on various health, economic, and social indicators. Through this project, I aimed to analyze real-world data, extract insights, and apply regression algorithms to understand what features most influence life expectancy.
